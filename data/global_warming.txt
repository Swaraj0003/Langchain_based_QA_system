Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, especially the emission of greenhouse gases. The primary contributors to this phenomenon are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere.

One of the most visible effects of global warming is the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which contributes to rising sea levels. Coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and erosion. Furthermore, global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.

Ecosystems around the world are also affected. Coral reefs, for example, are experiencing widespread bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures. Many plant and animal species are forced to migrate or face extinction due to shifting climate zones.

Another serious consequence is the impact on agriculture. Changes in rainfall patterns and growing seasons can reduce crop yields and threaten food security in many parts of the world.

To mitigate global warming, scientists and policymakers advocate for renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, carbon capture technologies, and reforestation. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature rise and promote sustainable development.

Educating people about the causes and effects of global warming is crucial to inspiring action and fostering a global response to climate change.
